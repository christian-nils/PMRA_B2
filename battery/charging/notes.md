Here is what was done during the capture "battery_ADC_test":

1. PMRA Serial RX to GND to enable factory test
2. Plug in the charger to wall plug and dock the robot
3. Select ADC test
4. Capture the serial printouts (see the CAP file) and the battery DS/CS (see the SAL file)
5. Stop the test by keeping the OK button long
6. Unplug the charger

Regarding the "battery_without_factory_test" capture, I simply docked the robot and checked the DS/CS lines of the battery. On the screen, it showed "Charging... 52%" at the beginning, at the end of the capture the screen showed "Charging... 56%".
