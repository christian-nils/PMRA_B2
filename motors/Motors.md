# Motor control

A digital signal analyser was used to capture the Serial communication between U13C and the main MCU (U2). There are three captures: 1) one with the motor disconnected, 2) one with the motor connected, and 3) one where the motor was turning and the wheel was held two times to try braking it. This is when running the factory test.
